EDAM provides a set of terms with synonyms and definitions - organised into an intuitive hierarchy for convenient use.\r\n\r\nYou can browse [EDAM at BioPortal](http://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/EDAM/).\r\n\r\nSee http://twitter.com/edamontology ([follow](https://twitter.com/intent/follow?original_referer=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fedamontology%2Fedamontology&region=follow_link&screen_name=edamontology&tw_p=followbutton)), please use [#edamontology](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23edamontology)\r\n\r\n# Motivation\r\nBioinformaticians handle an increasingly large and diverse set of tools and data. Meanwhile, researchers demand ever more powerful and convenient means to organise, find, understand, compare, select, use and connect the available resources. These tasks often rely on consistent, machine-understandable descriptions of the underlying components, but these have been generally lacking in _ad hoc_ resource descriptions. The urgent need - filled by EDAM - is for an ontology that unifies semantically the bioinformatics concepts in common use, provides the curator with a comprehensive controlled vocabulary that is broadly applicable, and supports new and powerful search, browse and query functions.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
